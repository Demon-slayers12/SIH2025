Indian Railways currently relies on the expertise of train traffic controllers to manage real-time train movements, but this manual approach is increasingly strained by rising congestion, limited infrastructure, and complex operational demands. Trains of different types and priorities must compete for shared track, junction, and platform resources, making scheduling and coordination a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with strict constraints related to safety, signalling, capacity, and punctuality. As disruptions and dynamic conditions further complicate decision-making, human intuition alone is insufficient to ensure efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven decision-support systems powered by optimization algorithms and artificial intelligence to enhance throughput, minimize delays, and maximize utilization of railway infrastructure.
